## Required Status Checks

- âœ… Security Scan
- âœ… Code Quality (Linting)
- âœ… Build Success

### For `staging` branch:
- âœ… Backend Tests
- âœ… Frontend Tests
- âœ… Code Quality (Linting)

## Review Requirements

- **main**: 2 approvals required
- **staging**: 1 approval required
- **develop**: 1 approval required
- **feature/***: No approval required

## Deployment Triggers

- **main** â†’ Production deployment
- **staging** â†’ Staging deployment
- **develop** â†’ No automatic deployment
- **feature/*** â†’ No deployment

## Hotfix Process

For critical production fixes:
1. Create `hotfix/issue-description` branch from `main`
2. Make minimal changes
3. Create PR to `main` with expedited review
4. After merge to `main`, cherry-pick to `staging`
5. Delete hotfix branch after deployment
