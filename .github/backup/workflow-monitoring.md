## 🔍 Monitoring Checklist

### **Week 1: Parallel Testing (Sep 28 - Oct 5)**

#### **Performance Metrics**
- [ ] **Execution Time Comparison**
  - [ ] Old workflows: ~35-45 minutes
  - [ ] New workflows: ~20-25 minutes (expected)
  - [ ] **Target:** 40% reduction

- [ ] **Resource Usage**
  - [ ] Old: 3 runners in parallel
  - [ ] New: 2 runners with conditional execution
  - [ ] **Target:** 33% reduction

- [ ] **Success Rate**
  - [ ] Old workflows: Monitor for regressions
  - [ ] New workflows: Monitor for failures
  - [ ] **Target:** No increase in failure rate

#### **Functionality Verification**
- [ ] **Main CI/CD Pipeline**
  - [ ] Backend linting and testing
  - [ ] Frontend building and testing
  - [ ] Security scanning
  - [ ] Coverage reporting

- [ ] **Parts Integration**
  - [ ] Parts change detection
  - [ ] Guardrails execution
  - [ ] Smoke tests
  - [ ] Database setup

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Blue-green deployment
  - [ ] Health checks
  - [ ] Rollback functionality

#### **Logging & Debugging**
- [ ] **Job Grouping**

## 📈 Expected Benefits (Week 1)

### **Performance Improvements**
- ⚡ **40% faster execution** (20-25 min vs 35-45 min)
- 💰 **33% less resource usage** (2 runners vs 3 runners)
- 🔧 **67% less code duplication** (reusable components)

### **Operational Improvements**
- 🔍 **Better debugging** (comprehensive logging)
- 📊 **Clearer monitoring** (job grouping)
- 🛡️ **Better failure isolation** (conditional execution)

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Rollback Plan**
1. **Immediate Rollback:** Disable new workflows if critical issues
2. **Partial Rollback:** Disable specific jobs if needed
3. **Full Rollback:** Re-enable all old workflows

### **Monitoring Alerts**
- [ ] Workflow failure rate > 10%
- [ ] Execution time > 30 minutes
- [ ] Resource usage > expected
- [ ] Critical functionality broken

---

## 📅 Migration Timeline

### **Phase 5.1: Parallel Testing (Current)**
- **Duration:** 1 week (Sep 28 - Oct 5)
- **Status:** ✅ Active
- **Goal:** Verify performance and functionality

### **Phase 5.2: Gradual Transition (Week 2)**
- **Duration:** 1 week (Oct 5 - Oct 12)
- **Goal:** Disable old workflows one by one
- **Order:** 
  1. `parts-integration-guardrails.yml` (least critical)
  2. `deploy-blue-green.yml` (after parts verification)
  3. `main_password_auth.yml` (most critical, last)

### **Phase 5.3: Cleanup (Week 3)**
- **Duration:** 1 week (Oct 12 - Oct 19)
- **Goal:** Delete old workflow files
- **Prerequisite:** 2 weeks of successful new workflows

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### **Week 1 Success Criteria**
- [ ] New workflows run successfully
- [ ] No increase in failure rate
- [ ] Performance improvements achieved
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

### **Week 2 Success Criteria**
