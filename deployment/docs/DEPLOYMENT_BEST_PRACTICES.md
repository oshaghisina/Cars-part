# üöÄ Deployment Best Practices Guide

This guide outlines best practices for deploying the China Car Parts application to ensure reliable, secure, and maintainable deployments.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] **Server Health Check**: Verify server resources (CPU, memory, disk space)
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Test SSH access and external connectivity
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Ensure all required software is installed and up-to-date
- [ ] **Security Updates**: Apply latest security patches to the server
- [ ] **Backup Verification**: Confirm backup systems are working
- [ ] **SSL Certificates**: Check certificate expiration dates

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Tests Pass**: All unit, integration, and e2e tests pass
- [ ] **Code Review**: All changes have been reviewed and approved
- [ ] **Security Scan**: Security vulnerabilities have been addressed
- [ ] **Performance Check**: Performance tests meet requirements
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated documentation for any changes

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All required environment variables are set
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Sensitive data is properly secured
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: All configuration files are valid
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Migration scripts are tested and ready

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Access Control
```bash
# Use dedicated deployment user with limited privileges
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer
sudo usermod -aG sudo deployer

# Configure SSH key-based authentication
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/deployment_key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/deployment_key.pub deployer@server

# Disable password authentication
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Secrets Management
```bash
# Use environment-specific secret files
# Never commit secrets to version control
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env.production
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/db" >> .env.production

# Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
# Store sensitive data in encrypted form
```

### Network Security
```bash
# Configure firewall rules
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw deny 8001/tcp  # Block direct access to API port

# Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for SSL termination
# Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
```

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Benefits:
# - Zero downtime deployments
# - Easy rollback capability
# - Risk isolation

# Implementation:
./deployment/scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh --deploy <commit-sha>
./deployment/scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh --switch
./deployment/scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh --rollback  # if needed
```

### Rolling Deployment (Suitable for Staging)
```bash
# Benefits:
# - Resource efficient
# - Gradual rollout
# - Automatic rollback on failure

# Implementation:
./deployment/scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

### Canary Deployment (Advanced)
```bash
# Benefits:
# - Risk mitigation
# - Performance monitoring
# - Gradual traffic shift

# Implementation:
# 1. Deploy to 10% of traffic
# 2. Monitor metrics for 30 minutes
# 3. Gradually increase to 100%
```

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
```bash
# Implement comprehensive health checks
curl -f http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health
curl -f http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health/detailed

# Monitor key metrics:
# - Response time
# - Error rate
# - Resource usage
# - Database connectivity
```

### Logging Strategy
```bash
# Structured logging with correlation IDs
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "api",
  "request_id": "req-123",
  "message": "User authentication successful",
  "user_id": "user-456"
}

# Log aggregation and analysis
# Use tools like ELK stack, Fluentd, or cloud logging services
```

### Alerting
```yaml
# Define alerting rules
alerts:
  - name: "High Error Rate"
    condition: "error_rate > 5%"
    duration: "5m"
    severity: "critical"
    
  - name: "High Response Time"
    condition: "response_time_p95 > 2s"
    duration: "10m"
    severity: "warning"
    
  - name: "Service Down"
    condition: "health_check_failed"
    duration: "1m"
    severity: "critical"
```

## üîÑ Database Management

### Migration Best Practices
```bash
# Always backup before migrations
cp /opt/china-car-parts/data/china_car_parts.db /opt/backups/pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db

# Test migrations on staging first
alembic upgrade head

# Use transactional migrations when possible
# Implement rollback scripts for complex changes
```

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Automated daily backups
0 2 * * * /opt/china-car-parts/scripts/backup-database.sh

# Retention policy:
# - Daily backups: 30 days
# - Weekly backups: 12 weeks
# - Monthly backups: 12 months

# Test backup restoration regularly
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Application Performance
```bash
# Use connection pooling
# Implement caching strategies
# Optimize database queries
# Use CDN for static assets
# Enable compression (gzip/brotli)

# Monitor performance metrics:
# - Response times
# - Throughput
# - Resource utilization
# - Database query performance
```

### Infrastructure Optimization
```bash
# Right-size server resources
# Use load balancers for high availability
# Implement auto-scaling when needed
# Use container orchestration for microservices
```

## üîß Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configurations
```yaml
# development.yml
database:
  url: "sqlite:///dev.db"
  echo: true

# staging.yml
database:
  url: "sqlite:///staging.db"
  echo: false

# production.yml
database:
  url: "postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
  echo: false
  pool_size: 20
```

### Feature Flags
```python
# Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
from app.core.config import settings

if settings.feature_flags.get("new_search_algorithm"):
    # Use new algorithm
    results = new_search(query)
else:
    # Use old algorithm
    results = old_search(query)
```

## üìà Deployment Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```yaml
deployment_metrics:
  success_rate: "> 95%"
  rollback_rate: "< 5%"
  deployment_time: "< 10 minutes"
  recovery_time: "< 5 minutes"
  
  quality_metrics:
    test_coverage: "> 80%"
    security_vulnerabilities: "0 critical"
    performance_regression: "< 5%"
```

### Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
# Track deployment metrics:
# - Deployment frequency
# - Lead time for changes
# - Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
# - Change failure rate

# Use tools like:
# - Grafana for dashboards
# - Prometheus for metrics collection
# - Jaeger for distributed tracing
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

### Deployment Windows
```bash
# Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods
# Avoid deployments during:
# - Peak business hours
# - Scheduled maintenance windows
# - Major events or releases

# Use feature flags to control rollouts
# Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
```

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Automated rollback triggers:
# - Health check failures
# - Error rate threshold exceeded
# - Performance degradation detected
# - Manual rollback request

# Rollback checklist:
# 1. Stop new deployments
# 2. Switch traffic to previous version
# 3. Verify system stability
# 4. Investigate root cause
# 5. Fix issues before re-deployment
```
