# Database-Service Alignment Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for ensuring consistent data synchronization between the Admin Panel and Customer Website, focusing on stock management and product content management. The goal is to create a unified data layer that prevents inconsistencies, race conditions, and ensures real-time reflection of changes across both interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stock Management Synchronization

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want stock updates in the Admin Panel to immediately reflect on the Customer Website, so that customers always see accurate inventory information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin updates stock quantity in the Admin Panel THEN the Customer Website PDP and PLP SHALL display the updated quantity within 1 second
2. WHEN multiple admins edit stock simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions using database-level locking
3. WHEN stock reaches zero THEN the Customer Website SHALL immediately show "Out of Stock" status
4. WHEN stock is added back THEN the Customer Website SHALL immediately show "In Stock" status
5. IF a customer attempts to purchase more than available stock THEN the system SHALL prevent overselling and show accurate available quantity

### Requirement 2: Product Content Management (PDP) Synchronization

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want product content changes (title, description, specs, images) to immediately appear on the Customer Website, so that customers always see the most current product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin updates product title, description, or specifications THEN the Customer Website PDP SHALL display the updated content within 1 second
2. WHEN an admin adds or removes product images THEN the Customer Website SHALL reflect the image changes immediately
3. WHEN an admin deletes a product THEN the Customer Website SHALL return appropriate 404 responses for that product
4. WHEN content changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for rollback capability
5. IF content update fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous version and notify admin

### Requirement 3: Cache Consistency Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want cache layers to be automatically invalidated when data changes, so that stale data is never served to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin makes any product or stock change THEN all relevant cache entries SHALL be invalidated immediately
2. WHEN cache invalidation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Customer Website queries data THEN it SHALL receive the most recent data from database if cache is stale
4. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain cache performance while ensuring data consistency

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see real-time product information and stock levels, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing product pages THEN stock levels SHALL be accurate within 1 second of any admin changes
2. WHEN browsing product lists THEN all product information SHALL be current and consistent
3. WHEN product becomes unavailable THEN it SHALL be immediately hidden or marked as unavailable
4. WHEN new products are added THEN they SHALL appear in customer searches and listings immediately

### Requirement 5: Data Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity across all interfaces, so that there are no inconsistencies between Admin Panel and Customer Website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cascading deletes occur THEN all related data SHALL be properly cleaned up without orphaned records
2. WHEN database transactions fail THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and maintain consistent state
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the operation and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Permission and Security Alignment

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure that Admin Panel operations are properly secured while Customer Website has appropriate read access, so that data security is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin performs write operations THEN proper authentication and authorization SHALL be verified
2. WHEN customer accesses product data THEN only public information SHALL be exposed
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
4. WHEN sensitive admin data exists THEN it SHALL never be exposed through customer-facing APIs

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want both Admin Panel and Customer Website to perform well under load, so that operations remain responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high concurrent admin operations occur THEN response times SHALL remain under 2 seconds
2. WHEN customer traffic spikes THEN product pages SHALL load within 1 second
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use optimized queries and proper indexing
4. WHEN system is under load THEN critical operations SHALL be prioritized over non-critical ones

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of data synchronization, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN metrics SHALL be collected on sync latency and success rates
2. WHEN synchronization fails THEN alerts SHALL be sent to administrators immediately
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL provide detailed diagnostics
4. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN automated reconciliation SHALL be attempted
